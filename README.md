# Quantik solver

Implementation of a strong solver for [Quantik](https://en.gigamic.com/game/quantik), a 2-player adversarial abstract strategy game by Nouri Khalifa and published by Gigamic.

**PROJECT STATUS:** Currently in development. Come back soon!

## To do

A minimal working implementation of the solver is now ready to go. However, there's a bunch of code cleanup and documentation to do.

- create a Makefile to build tests, demos and the main program
- document creation of opening book
- make the code pretty to read
- complete unimplemented functions of the solver
- fill in `MANIFEST.in`
- document usage and package
